# Problem Solving 101

Notes from Ken Watanabe's [Problem Solving 101](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6271219-problem-solving-101)

- Key Behaviour
  - Take overcoming challenges in stride
  - Think about the root causes
  - Design and mapping specific plans before taking action
  - Willing to rework a plan as new challenges arrive
  - Setting goals
  - Positive attribute
  - Focused on what can be changed
  - Constantly monitoring progress
  - Examples:
    - “Okay! I’m going to accomplish this within three months.”
    - “This is a problem, but rather than worrying about it, I’m going to figure out what I can do about it.”
    - “So what really caused this?”
    - “To fix this, we’re going to need to do X, Y, and Z. Let’s try them out.”
    - “So how did this work out? What went wrong? Is there a way we could do this better next time?”
  - Feedback greatly improves your ability to problem solve
- Process:
  - What: Understand the current situation
  - Why: Identify the root cause of the problem, continously break the problem down
  - How: Develop an effective plan
  - Execute: Until you arrive at the solution, making modifications on the way

# Diagnose/Solve Strategy

## 1. Diagnose the Situation and Develop the Root Cause

### 1a. List all potential root causes

- Discover all the problems into a logic tree
- Transform a logic tree into a yes/no tree

### 1b. Develop a Hypothesis

- Look at the components of the problem, determine what you think is the root cause of the problem
- Example: Alarm clock didn't ring?
  - Hypothesis: The battery ran out
  - Test: Check the battery works in another device
  - Resolution: The battery worked, the hypothesis is incorrect, must not of been the battery

### 1c. Determine Which Analysis and Information Required to Test Hypothesis

- What data and questions can you ask that will prove/disprove the hypothesis?
- What are the most efficient, effective and most sensible methods of gathering data?
- Don't gather data just for the sake of it, how will the data help dis/prove the hypothesis?
- Use a problem solving design plan

### 1d. Analyse & Identify the Root Causes

- Extrapolate from analysis, what does the data tell you about hypotheses? Can you derive the root causes?

## 2. Solve the Problem

### 2a. Develop a Wide Variety of Solutions to Solve the Problem

- Brainstorm as many possible solutions as you can
  - Ignore feasibility, any idea is a good idea
  - Use a logic tree

### 2b. Prioritise Actions

- Validate effectiveness and sensibility of each solution against root causes
  - Which solutions are the most effective?
  - Any quick wins?
  - Are solutions more effective by getting help or leveraging others strengths
- Example: Plot solutions against impact versus ease of implementation on a graph. Solutions can be prioritised by impact/difficulty

### 2c. Develop an Implementation Plan

- Which tasks will be implemented?
- Who will be actioning the tasks?
- What do the timeframes look like?


### 2d. Measure Results

- What happened after the tasks were implemented?
- Has the problem been solved?

### Tools

#### Logic Tree

- Helps when trying to identify root causes of a problem
- Break down problem into categories
  - Categories are exhaustive
  - Categories don't overlap
  - Can start at any hierarchy
  - "How can I divide this problem"
  - "What can I break this up into"
  - "Why is this problem happening"
- Example:
  - How can I increase the amount of pepper that comes from one shake of the bottle
    - Increase the surface area
    - Increase the throughput of the surface area
      - Increase the number of holes
      - Increase the size of the holes
      - Reduce the size of the pepper grains
  - Approach:
    - Diagnose the situation and identify cause of the problem
      - List all potential root causes
      - Develop a hypothesis for the likely root cause
      - Determine information required to test hypothesis
      - Analyse and identify root cause
    - Develop the solution
      - Develop a variety of solutions
      - Prioritise actions
      - Develop an implementation plan

#### Yes/No Tree

- Used to find a root cause of a problem or decide how to solve a problem
- Keep asking yes/no questions for each fork in the logic tree
  - Did the alarm ring?
    - Yes: Is the alarm clock ticking?
      - Yes: Was the alarm set?
        - Yes: Was it switched on?
        - No: I didn't set it correctly
      - No: Is the battery in?
        - Yes: Was the battery charged?
        - No: The battery wasn't in


#### Problem Solving Design Plan

- Used to validate analysis data points
- For each data point (eg: question), tabulate the hypothesis, rationale, analysis activity, information source
- Example:
  - Issue: Why are people who know about the concert not coming?
  - Hypothesis: They don't like rock music
  - Rationale: What rock music fan wouldn't come to a free show?
  - Analysis Activity: Interview 5 people who knew but didn't come
  - Information Source: Survey
