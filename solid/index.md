title: "SOLID Principles"
---
- How to arrange functions and data into logical groupings and how they should be connected
- Goal: Create software that tolerates change, easy to understand, can be shared
  - WARNING: Over-use of any principle can lead to over fragmentation, making it difficult to maintain. Know when and how to balance these principles
- Single Responsibility Principle
  - There should only be one reason for a component to change
  - eg: A component that omits output should implement an output component instead of maintaining to output code itself
- Open Closed Principle
  - Open for extension, closed for modification. Changes should be applied by adding new code, instead of changing existing code
  - eg: A quiz printer that outputs content depending on the quiz item type should be refactoring by accepting "QuizType" interfaces, which implements a print function, alleviating the switch case
  - Switch-case statements can be signs of violation
