# Introduction

- Laws of Software Architecture
  - Everything in software architecture is a trade-off
  - Why is more important than how

# Architectural Thinking

- Architecture VS Design
  - Design infers that architecture is a siloed effort from the architecture and then handed to the development team
  - Architecture requires a collaborative effort where leadership and mentoring provides a feedback loop through the entire SDLC
- Wide breadth of technical knowledge at a certain depth
  - A developer will gain particular knowledge in a certain area, they will become very good at solving particular problems, an architect will gain knowledge in diverse areas but with less technical depth, they will be very good at being aware of multiple solutions for a particular problem
   - Avoid trying to maintain too much depth in too many areas
   - Avoid thinking that stale/outdated knowledge is cutting edge
- Understanding trade-offs between solutions and technologies
- How business drivers correlate with architecture concerns
