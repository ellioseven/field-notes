---

- LeBlanc's law: Later equals never
- Boy scout rule: Leave it cleaner than when you found it
- It's the programmers job to protect the code
- Resist the temptation to take shortcuts that give the illusion of time savings and impede cleanliness
- Cleaning code is applied with a series of behaviour preserving transformations
- Elements of messy code
  - Consistently being slowed down by systemic issues
  - Refactor requests
  - Simple changes become complex
  - Tempts more messy code
  - Tries to do too much
  - No tests
- Elements of clean code
  - Readable
  - Obvious and what you expect, unsurpising
  - Small (routines, API, abstractions)
  - Minimal
  - Minimal dependencies
  - Minimal duplication
  - Care has been taken
  - Contains only what is necessary
  - Easy to adapt
  - Single focused and unpolluted by the code around it
